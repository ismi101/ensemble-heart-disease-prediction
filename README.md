# Heart Disease Prediction using Ensemble Learning

The goal of this study was to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast heart diseases.

The chosen algorithms were :
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

Each method was evaluated separately before combining some of them to make a hybrid model. The
combination was designed to take advantage of each algorithm's advantages, improving
predictability and interpretability. To make the final predictions, we employed an ensemble
approach, integrating the results of various algorithms and using voting or averaging methods. We
also used a stacked model approach using a deep neural network, and based on how well the chosen
algorithms worked together and how well they complement one another, they were selected
